        <p>Japanese cuisine encompasses the regional and traditional foods of Japan, which have developed through centuries of political, economic,</p>
        <p>and social changes. The traditional cuisine of Japan  is based on rice with miso soup and other dishes; there is an emphasis on seasonal </p>
        <p>ingredients. Side dishes often consist of fish, pickled vegetables, and vegetables cooked in broth. Seafood is common, often grilled, but also </p>
        <p>served raw as sashimi or in sushi. Seafood and vegetables are also deep-fried in a light batter, as tempura. Apart from rice, a staple </p>
        <p>includes noodles, such as soba and udon. Japan also has many simmered dishes, such as fish products in broth called oden, or beef in </p>
        <p>sukiyaki and nikujaga.</p>
        <p>Historically influenced by Chinese cuisine, Japanese cuisine has also opened up to influence from Western cuisines in the modern era.</p>
        <p>Dishes inspired by foreign food—in particular Chinese food—like ramen and gyōza, as well as foods like spaghetti, curry and </p>
        <p>hamburgers, have been adapted to Japanese tastes and ingredients. Some regional dishes have also become familiar throughout Japan, </p>
        <p>including the taco rice staple of Okinawan cuisine that has itself been influenced by American and Mexican culinary traditions. Traditionally, </p>
        <p>the Japanese shunned meat as a result of adherence to Buddhism, but with the modernization of Japan in the 1880s, meat-based dishes such</p>
        <p> as tonkatsu and yakiniku have become common. Since this time, Japanese cuisine, particularly sushi and ramen, has become popular globally.</p>
