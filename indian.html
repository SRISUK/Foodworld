        <p>Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to India. Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic</p>
        <p>groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.</p>
        <p>Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism and Islam, cultural choices and traditions.</p>
        <p>Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in introducing certain foods to this country. The </p>
        <p>Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruit to India. A number of these such as potatoes,</p>
        <p> tomatoes, chillies, peanuts, and guava have become staples in many regions of India.</p>
        <p>Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations; the spice trade between India and Europe was the primary catalyst for </p>
        <p>Europe's Age of Discovery. Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe and Asia. Indian cuisine has influenced other cuisines </p>
        <p>across the world, especially those from Europe (especially Britain), the Middle East, Southern African, East Africa, Southeast Asia, North </p>
        <p>America, Mauritius, Fiji, Oceania, and the Caribbean.</p>
