        <p>Mexican cuisine consists of the cooking cuisines and traditions of the modern country of Mexico. Its earliest roots lie in Mesoamerican </p>
        <p>cuisine, but also Iberian Europe. Its ingredients and methods begin with the first agricultural communities such as the Olmec and Maya </p>
        <p>who domesticated maize, created the standard process of nixtamalization, and established their foodways. Successive waves of </p>
        <p>other Mesoamerican groups brought with them their cooking methods. These included: the Teotihuacanos, Toltec, Huastec, Zapotec, Mixtec,</p>
        <p>Otomi, Pur√©pecha, Totonac, Mazatec, Mazahua, and Nahua. With the Mexica formation of the multi-ethnic Triple Alliance (Aztec Empire),</p>
        <p>culinary foodways became infused (Aztec cuisine).</p>
        <p>Today's food staples native to the land include corn (maize), turkey, beans, squash, amaranth, chia, avocados, tomatoes, tomatillos, cacao,</p>
        <p>vanilla, agave, spirulina, sweet potato, cactus, and chili pepper. Its history over the centuries has resulted in regional cuisines based on</p>
        <p>local conditions, including Baja Med, Chiapas, Veracruz, Oaxacan, and the American cuisines of New Mexican and Tex-Mex.</p>
        <p>After the Spanish Conquest of the Aztec empire and the rest of Mesoamerica, Spaniards introduced a number of other foods, the most </p>
        <p>important of which were meats from domesticated animals (beef, pork, chicken, goat, and sheep), dairy products (especially cheese and milk),</p>
        <p>rice, sugar, olive oil and various fruits and vegetables. Various cooking styles and recipes were also introduced from Spain both throughout </p>
        <p>the colonial period and by Spanish immigrants who continued to arrive following independence. Spanish influence in Mexican cuisine is also </p>
        <p>noticeable in its sweets such as: alfajores, alfeniques, borrachitos and churros.</p>
