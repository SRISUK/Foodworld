        <p>French cuisine is the cooking traditions and practices from France. In the 14th century, Guillaume Tirel, a court chef known as "Taillevent", </p>
        <p>wrote Le Viandier, one of the earliest recipe collections of medieval France. In the 17th century, chefs François Pierre La Varenne and </p>
        <p>Marie-Antoine Carême spearheaded movements that shifted French cooking away from its foreign influences and developed France's own indigenous style.</p>
        <p>Cheese and wine are a major part of the cuisine. They play different roles regionally and nationally, with many variations and appellation</p>
        <p>d'origine contrôlée (AOC) (regulated appellation) laws.</p>
        <p>Culinary tourism and the Guide Michelin helped to acquaint commoners with the cuisine bourgeoise of the urban elites and the</p>
        <p>peasant cuisine of the French countryside starting in the 20th century. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in variations across the country.</p>
        <p>Knowledge of French cooking has contributed significantly to Western cuisines. Its criteria are used widely in Western cookery school boards </p>
        <p>and culinary education. In November 2010, French gastronomy was added by the UNESCO to its lists of the world's "intangible cultural heritage".</p>
